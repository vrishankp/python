# python
Here are some of my python programs

# Monopoly
Enter the number of dice rolls to simulate
Returns Number of times the character ends a turn on each tile. This means some tiles (like Go to Jail) don't have anything as the character never ends a turn on that tile.

# Birthday
Enter a number of iterations (more will make it more accurate, but use more resources to calculate)
Returns the percent of time that a "room" of 23 people have the same birthday

# 3n+1
Enter a number
Returns the "Stopping Time": The number of attempts it takes to turn a number into 1 following the Collatz Conjecture

# collatz
Enter the maximum number
Returns the stopping time for each number from 1 to the maximum number inputed

# golden
Enter a number
Returns the ratio between 2 numbers of the fibonnaci sequences, starting with the first 2 and ending with the inputed number. The numbers get closer the golden ration.

# fib
Enter the number
Returns the fibonnaci at the place of the given number and the time it takes to accomplish

# fib2
Returns the first 100 fibonnaci numbers and time it takes to calculate that

# prime
Enter a number
Returns all the primes from 1 to the inputed number, the count of number of primes, and the time it took to calculate

# prime2
Enter a number
Returns the first primes from 1 to the inputed number and time it takes to calculate it
